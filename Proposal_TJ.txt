Stage 2

Our goal is to create an IoT system that monitors and controls the temperature and humidity levels in a 
greenhouse. The system will collect real-time data from sensors placed inside the greenhouse and use it to make 
informed decisions about when to activate a water sprinkler or turn on a fan to adjust the temperature and 
humidity levels. The main objective is to create a sustainable and efficient environment for plant growth, 
resulting in increased yield and reduced energy consumption

System Architecture: Our IoT system will consist of three main components: the sensors, the cloud platform, and 
the dashboard. The sensors will be connected to a Raspberry Pi which will collect the data and send it to the 
cloud platform using MQTT protocol. The cloud platform will use Django/Flask and InfluxDB database to store the 
data and provide real-time analysis and decision-making capabilities. The dashboard will use Grafana to 
visualize the data and provide a user-friendly interface for users to monitor the system.

Sensor: We will be using a Raspberry Pi as our IoT sensor. It will be connected to a DHT22 sensor for 
temperature and humidity measurements. We will be using the MQTT protocol for data transmission to the cloud 
platform.

Cloud Platform: We will be using PythonAnywhere as our web hosting service for the Django/Flask app. The app 
will use InfluxDB to store the data. The app will analyze the data to make decisions on when to turn on/off the 
water sprinkler or fan.

Dashboard: We will be using Grafana to create our dashboard. The dashboard will display 
real-time temperature and humidity readings from the sensors, along with graphs showing historical trends. It 
will also provide controls for users to turn on/off the water sprinkler or fan. We plan to use Figma to design 
the dashboard interface.

Video Demo: We will record a video demo of our Django/Flask app running on 
PythonAnywhere and provide a link to it on our Github page.
